## Color Scheme for UI Elements

UI Element | Suggested Color | Rationale
--- | --- | ---
Background of forms | `#090040` (Dark Blue) | Dark background for focus
Form input borders | `#471396` (Purple) | Subtle but visible border color
Buttons (default) | `#471396` (Purple) | Consistent button background
Buttons (hover) | `#B13BFF` (Bright Purple) | Hover highlight for UX feedback
Buttons (text) | `#FFCC00` (Yellow) | Contrasting text visible on dark background
Saved items container | `#090040` (Dark Blue) or transparent | Keep it clean and unified
Image container border | `#FFCC00` (Yellow) | Highlight icons elegantly
Links text color | `#FFCC00` (Yellow) or white (`#FFF`) | Ensure readability on dark background
